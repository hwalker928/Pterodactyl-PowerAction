# Pterodactyl-PowerAction
A Discord Bot Which Can Be Used To Control Your Pterodactyl Server's Power Actions

This Code Can Be Made Easily Than This , But I Have Made This More Extended To Make You Guys Understand The Concept Here!


Pterodactylv2 file

The New Version Is Made With Discord.py V2 Which Is More Clean And Have Buttons instead Of Messaging The Power-Action Command


The Source Code Is Made in Cogs/Extension Format , I Recommend To Use Cogs as It Would Be Clean And Efficient

If You Need To Use The SRC in main.py and dpy v1 then Use pterodactyl.py file which is Older Version
